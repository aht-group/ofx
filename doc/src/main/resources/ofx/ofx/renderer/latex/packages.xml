	                "Font Awesome" gives you scalable vector icons that can instantly be customized - size, color, 
	                drop shadow, and anything that can be done with the power of CSS.

	                <t:cell><ofx:paragraph>
	                This package gives you easy access to the Lorem Ipsum dummy text - an option is available to 
	                separate the paragraphs of the dummy text into TeXparagraphs.

	                The package lets the user mark things to do later, in a simple and visually appealing way. 
	                The package takes several options to enable customization/finetuning of the visual appearance.

	                <t:cell><ofx:paragraph>
	                The package provides the "\multido" command, which was originally designed for use with "PSTricks". 
	                Fixed-point arithmetic is used when working on the loop variable, so that the package is equally applicable
	                in graphics applications like "PSTricks" as it is with the more common integer loops.

	                This package can disable all hyphenation or enable hyphenation of nonalphabetics or monospaced fonts.
	                It can also enable hyphenation within ‘words’ that contain nonalphabetic characters
	                (e.g., that include underscores), and hyphenation of text typeset in monospaced (e.g., cmtt) fonts.

	                This package provides advanced facilities for inline and display quotations. 
	                It is designed for a wide range of tasks ranging from the most simple applications to the more complex
	                demands of formal quotations.

	                <t:cell><ofx:paragraph>
	                The glossaries package supports acronyms and multiple glossaries, and has provision for operation in several 
	                languages (using the facilities of either babel or polyglossia). New entries are defined to have a name and 
	                description (and optionally an associated symbol).

	                <t:cell><ofx:paragraph>
	                The package provides commands "\makefirstuc" that uppercases the first letter in its argument, and
	                "\xmakefirstuc" which expands the argument before uppercasing.

	                <t:cell><ofx:paragraph>
	                The package redefines the LaTeX internal "\@for" macro so that the loop may be prematurely terminated.
	                The action is akin to the C/Java break statement, except that the loop does not terminate until the end 
	                of the current iteration.

	                datagidx.sty - indexing or creating glossaries/lists of acronyms, 
	                databib.sty - a bibliography may be loaded into a data-tool database, and manipulated there before being printed, 
	                person.sty - displaying a person’s name and pronoun in a document

	                <t:cell><ofx:paragraph>
	                The tracklang package is provided for package developers who want a simple interface to find out which
	                languages the user has requested through packages such as babel or polyglossia. 
	                (This package does not provide any translations! Its purpose is simply to track which languages have been 
	                requested by the user.)

	                <t:cell><ofx:paragraph>
	                The package aims to provide a ‘one-stop’ solution to requirements for footnotes. 
	                It offers: Multiple footnote,formatted in separate paragraphs, or be run into a single paragraph.
	                Things you might have expected (such as "\verb-like" material in footnotes, and colour selections over page breaks)

	                <t:cell><ofx:paragraph>
	                The package provides macros for manipulating strings — testing a string’s contents, extracting substrings, 
	                substitution of substrings and providing numbers such as string length, position of, or number of recurrences of 
	                a substring.

	                <t:cell><ofx:paragraph>
	                The package provides an environment, tabu, which will make any sort of tabular (that doesn't need to split across pages), 
	                and an environment longtabu which provides the facilities of tabu in a modified longtable environment. 
	                (Note that this latter offers an enhancement of ltxtable.)

	                <t:cell><ofx:paragraph>
	                The varwidth environment is superficially similar to minipage, but the specified width is just a maximum value —

	                Provides enumerate and itemize environments that can be used within paragraphs to format the items either as running text
	                or as separate paragraphs with a preceding number or symbol. Also provides compacted versions of enumerate and itemize.

	                This package provides user control over the layout of the three basic list environments: enumerate, itemize and description.
	                It supersedes both enumerate and mdwlist (providing well-structured replacements for all their funtionality), and in addition
	                provides functions to compute the layout of labels, and to ‘clone’ the standard environments, to create new environments

	                The package creates three environments: framed - which puts an ordinary frame box around the region) 
	                shaded - which shades the region), leftbar - which places a line at the left side. The environments allow a break at 
	                their start (the "\FrameCommand" enables creation of a title that is “attached” to the environment),

	                This package provides the command "\marginnote" that may be used instead of "\marginpar" at almost every place where 
	                "\marginpar" cannot be used, e.g., inside floats, footnotes, or in frames made with the framed package.

	                <t:cell><ofx:paragraph>
	                The basic command of the package is "\relsize", whose argument is a number of "\magsteps" to change size; from this are 
	                defined commands "\larger", "\smaller", "\textlarger", etc.

	                This package is designed to format menu sequences, paths and keyboard shortcuts automatically. There are several 
	                predefined styles and one can define his own styles in a flexible way.

	                <t:cell><ofx:paragraph>
	                The package changes package loading internals so that all subsequently loaded packages can rely on normal/standard 
	                catcodes of all ASCII characters. The package defines canonical control sequences to represent all the visible 
	                ASCII characters. It also provides robust option parsing mechanisms (XDeclareOption, XExecuteOptions and XProcessOptions,
	                which will be used by "\documentclass" if the package has already been loaded).

	                The listliketab package helps the user make list-like tabulars, i.e., a tabular that is indistinguishable from an 
	                itemize or enumerate environment. The advantage of using a tabular is that the user can add additional columns to 
	         		each entry in the list.

	                <t:cell><ofx:paragraph>
	                The package is known to work in LaTeX documents processed with pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX. If makeindex is used 
	                for processing the index entries, no particular setting up is needed when TeX Live is used. Using xindy or other 
	                programs it is necessary to enable shell escape; shell escape is also needed if splitindex is used.

	                The package offers support for drawing tree diagrams, and is especially suitable for linguistics use. It allows 
	                trees to be specified in a simple bracket notation, automatically calculates branch sizes, and supports both 
	                DVI/PostScript and PDF output by use of pict2e facilities.

	                <t:cell><ofx:paragraph>
	                The package extends the existing LaTeX picture environment, using the familiar technique (cf. the graphics and 
	                color packages) of driver files (at present, drivers for PostScript output from LaTeX, and for use with pdfLaTeX 
	                are available). The package documentation has a fair number of examples of use, showing where things are 
	                improved by comparison with the LaTeX picture environment.

	                The package provides a macro "\Inline" that precedes a "\def" or "\gdef". Within the definition text of an inlined 
	                definition, keywords such as "\Expand" may be used to selectively inline certain expansions at definition-time. 
	                This eases the process of redefining macros in terms of the original definition, as well as definitions in which the token 
	                that must be expanded is deep within, where "\expandafter" would be difficult and "\edef" is not suitable. Another 
	                application is as an easier version of "\aftergroup", by defining a macro in terms of expanded local variables, 
	                then ending the group with "\expandafter", "\endgroup", "\macro".
